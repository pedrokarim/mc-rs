Full survival gameplay experience including combat, crafting, hunger, world generation, and more. Why Rust: performance, memory safety without garbage collector, fearless concurrency with async/await and channels, strong type system catches bugs at compile time. Comparison with BDS official C++ server, PocketMine-MP PHP, Nukkit Java, Dragonfly Go. Project status: 5 phases completed covering networking, protocol, world, gameplay, plugins, and operations."
